(00:02) hello everyone and welcome you all to another chapter of the Instagram marketing course so now we are on our chapter number nine where I'll be showing you guys the things to remember for Instagram content okay so once you start posting your content that is not the end okay so that is just the beginning and the main thing after that is how you're going to continue on posting your content on Instagram okay so there are few things to remember once you start posting your content so let's see what are those and what we are
(00:42) able to get from this particular tutorial so the topic over here is things to remember for Instagram content so the first thing what I'm going to do are what I'm going to tell is once you start posting your content in your Instagram handle you need to maintain consistency okay and don't get messed up or don't get confused but I'll explain you guys what do I mean by when I tell that maintain consistency okay let's say now uh today for your business only you are working okay so in that particular
(01:24) case what you can basically do is you guys can just start with one single post so let's say you are planning okay uh in a day I will just post one thing let's say today I will post up a story tomorrow I will just go out with some photos and on the third day maybe I will just post on some videos or some real okay so you need to make sure that you are doing it on a continuous basis let's say you did it for a month uh you did it for two months now you did it for 3 months so next thing after 3 months what
(02:00) you need to do is you need to make sure that you are posting two images uh two stories and also two reals okay so likewise you guys can just increase the frequency of your post time to time depending on how much you can take it won't be proper let's say today you posted two videos and also after uh one month or after a month or two again you posted seven videos after 3 weeks you did post six videos so that is not the thing let's say in your description or in your bio you guys can just promise your viewer or your
(02:42) follower that each week I will come up with a video or each week I'm going to give you guys some content or some videos you guys can just promise and you need to make sure that you fulfill that particular period notice period because if you're influence of if you are a Creator you want to do your Marketing in that case you need to make sure that you maintain the consistency and once you don't maintain the consistency what happens is like the algorithm also changes and on Instagram only it won't
(03:17) push your account to other people okay so all this well I was talking about the most organic uh thing okay like how you will basically push your account through a organic growth that is what what you need to do uh at start okay and also now the next point is don't miss any date for your post okay so as I've already told you that what do I mean by that you don't you should not miss any date let's say you did promise that okay each day I am going to post up a photo each day I'm going to post up a flyer or a banner so
(03:55) in that case you should not miss any date and don't forget to post your stories and stuff make sure to schedule those accordingly and also once you see that okay you are getting proper reach after getting the insides of your account you see okay uh so many people are actually watching my vide so many people are basically uh going through my stories okay I am getting a proper response in that particular case again you guys can improve the quality okay so if there is two contents maybe you guys can increase that and also you guys can
(04:32) improve the whole quality of the video okay you guys can use some uh different cameras let's say if you're taking any kind of video you guys can use some better graphics and always there is room to improve okay so make sure to improve day by day go on with the trend and also with time if you do have a team later you guys can increase the frequency of your post Okay so so sometimes what happens and if you're thinking that okay I will start doing Instagram marketing for my business and within a month or
(05:08) two I will get the result like if 100 people without any marketing is coming to uh my shop then maybe after doing one month of Instagram marketing 500 600 people will basically come to my store okay so you should not be losing your patient okay so this is basically a long game okay you need to play it for a pretty long time you need to maintain that consistency you should have that patience and you should just keep on putting your effort you guys can tell your friends to recommend to their friends and that is how never uh reduce
(05:46) your effort because eventually it will lead you to lose your follower and also your engagement let's say today you feel like okay I'm not getting any response whatsoever but I won't make my story today like if you feel like okay I won't post anything today let me just post after through 2 three days and if you continuously do that on a regular basis what will happen is you will basically lose your follower okay so the follower what they will see is okay basically he did promise this thing but he didn't post today there
(06:23) might be people those who are waiting okay those who are liking what you guys basically post so they might be wai but once you don't keep their promises what happens is they basically lose their trust on you and also once they lose their trust they might unfollow you and they might not take you seriously or the service you are providing and that's how you guys won't be able to engage with your customer again like before okay so you need to keep this thing mind and make sure to do that accordingly and
(06:55) the next point right over here is maintain a content content calendar okay so I do have told you guys about content calendar what all you should do how you need to maintain let's say you guys can make it on a notepad you guys can basically make it on a Excel sheet okay so I'll be showing you guys also how you can actually map that one up just very simple okay I will just show you guys in Excel itself like you need to maintain a Content calendar and you need to make sure that what time you want to post
(07:29) what so now let's move on to excel I'll be showing you you guys that in Excel you guys can use uh other platforms you guys can use a Google spreadsheet you guys can use word you guys can use notepad totally depends up to uh yourself okay like how you like to uh schedule your content so let's move on to that first so over here as you guys can see I am here in the Excel sheet and from my Excel sheet now the next thing is if you do want to create a calendar you need to make sure of the date first okay let's
(08:06) come here and if you do want to let's say on date first okay I can just type the date or otherwise I can basically type out the type as well okay let's say I will just start with Sunday okay and after that let's come here and let's type Monday and now what I can do is I can select this one and I will just select this one as well and from here I can just drag this one out right from here let's come to this position and from here you guys can just drag this thing down and let's go till
(08:46) Saturday right over here so now I already do have the dates and from here what I can do is I can just type out the timing let's go with 10 a.m. let let's come here let's go with 12 p.m. otherwise 12 p.m. and if I just come down 4 p.m. and I'll just come down let's go with 6 p.m.
(09:25) let's come down over here 8 p.m. and over here lastly let's go with 10 p.m and 12 or let's go with one am right over here so once you're right over here you guys can see that let's centralize this one let's select this one and from here let's centralize this and once this particular thing is basically done you guys can just put that wherever you do want to actually post or what particular time let's say on Sunday I want to post IG story okay so I'll just post story at 10:00 a.m. let's come here on Sunday
(10:22) itself at 8:00 I will just post a photo let's say brocher okay so I'll just come here and I will just type that I want to actually post up a brocher in this particular type okay so you guys can come here and you guys can just check this thing out as well and after that let's say at 100 p.m.
(10:51) what I want to do is I want to come here and I want to post up a real okay so I will just make up a schedule let's say and this particular time I need to post up a real so the next day what I can actually do is let's say at 12: a.m. I will be posting a photo at 6: a.m. I'll be posting up a reel and at 10 p.m.
(11:17) I will be posting up a story okay so that is my schedule and I can just do it right all over here you can also include that on a holiday let's say on Sunday from 4 to six okay let's say I will just select both of this and I can just click on merch and center and from here I will just click on go live okay so at this particular date what you guys can do is you guys can come here and you guys can just go live at this particular time you guys can just mention that thing right over here as well so you will have a
(11:54) better idea and if you do want to color these things up let's come here and let's just uh differentiate the color from here let's come and let's put this color let's go to the sides and let's put some uh different color over here as well okay so this is how you guys can actually work and make your calendar okay if you do want to put out dates it's fine you guys can also put out dates okay let's say if you come here and if you just uh want to increase it let's come here and from here you do
(12:35) want to increase it okay let's say you want to increase the spacing over here and on top at particular place you guys can also put up the date let's say one uh you guys can just put out the second date here you guys can just put out the third fourth fifth sixth and accordingly you guys can just put out all the numbers just on top and underneath you guys can just give some different color okay let's say if I come right over here let's say I will just come here let's go with first and I will just
(13:17) click over here and I will just select this one let's say I will just select the content let me just put it right over here on top and after that if I just come here and let's say I will just type now story okay so I will just put on story and basically what I will understand looking at this is okay on first I need to post story in my Instagram handle at 10 a.m.
(13:53) okay so the day will be a Sunday okay and also from 4: to 6:00 a.m. on that particular day basically I need to go on Instagram uh live okay so I will have the whole schedule all by myself right over here and that is how you guys can just create one so this was about the calendar how to create one okay how to simplify it all for yourself so now let's see what are the next things we need to remember once we working on Instagram content so the next page over here tells me had conversation with your followers
(14:34) okay so you need to keep in mind that you do have a proper conversation with your followers or the people who are actually following you or basically commenting on your post so there are different ways to do that let's say if they send you a message to get any information regarding anything you guys can just uh uh give them a reply okay if you do have very low if you're just starting on with your marketing so you guys can do that but once you have a lot of followers then you do have to keep some different individuals just only to
(15:08) maintain your account okay because your official account you won't be able to use all by yourself because there will be so many messages coming uh so many of the things will be going on on your particular page so you keep some dedicated people only for that okay so in that case try to have a conversation with your followers and the next point is try to maintain a interactive communication between you and your follower through post or going live okay so as I was already telling you that there are different ways of how you can
(15:45) have a conversation with your followers and one is through a post like if you just post anything if you do ask them any kind of thing like uh tell me what I do what I should do in my next uh video like you can just post it in your stories or let's say okay after one week my video is coming get prepared and stuff you can post it in your channel you can just post before few days that okay my video is going to be about this particular topic so how aware you guys are about this so you guys will see in the comment section that people will
(16:23) basically share their own thoughts on that okay that means that basically they're having some convers iation on your particular post right so make sure to use that that your uh group or your page basically stays uh active like people are coming there daily they're just sharing their views uh the questions you're asking they're responsive okay so make sure to do that so that is another way of how you can actually maintain a interactive communication between you and the follower okay and also let's say you to
(16:58) post anything and in the comment section of your post people did ask you something let's say you were providing a service you guys can tell that uh let's say you do have some emergency and you had to close your restaurant down but there are people those who will see your post that okay at this particular day I should go to his restaurant so in your Instagram story or in your Instagram post you guys can post that okay at this particular date maybe I will be uh not there so we will be closed you guys can
(17:30) just give that particular information okay so what will happen is if there if those people are basically coming just to your restaurant and if they come and see that it is closed they will think that okay that's not up to the point like there is no news that it will be closed but once we came so far just to visit your restaurant but it's close it will just give them a disappointment and maybe next time they won't come to your place as as well but at because at that particular time if they didn't get your
(18:03) restaurant maybe they'll go to somewhere else because there are already disappointed and if they ask you in the comment section that okay uh for what you can just tell this are there are some personal problems so due to that reason I will be closing off but from the next working day it will turn back on again okay so you can't have a interactive communication with your follower and the next point over here is comment in others post okay so you need to make sure that you do comment in others post as well the people those who
(18:39) are basically doing the same kind of work okay you guys can just uh comment in their post if you do want to and the people those who are actually using your hashtag or the hashtag which you have actually created let's say they do have visited your restaurant and now they do have tagged your restaurant in their post so you can just give up a comment because what it shows is that okay you did care let's say if someone just left a very good review okay you guys can just tell them that thank you so much
(19:10) sir we are actually glad that you had this particular experience and also comment if there are any negative comments as well let's say if some people they tell okay that was a horrible experience I won't ever visit to this restaurant again okay you guys can tell that okay if there was an inconvenience from from our side we are very sorry but we will make sure that the next time you visit there won't be any problem as such okay you guys can just give them commitment and let's say you guys can tell them next time when
(19:40) you come we do have a 25% discount for you only okay so over here you guys can just have this particular conversation which will basically uh win their trust okay so you guys can actually use this particular methods as well and also the last point is engage with other accounts okay so over here you need to make sure that if uh you guys are collaborating about anything you guys can just collaborate with one uh one account let's say you do have your page and there is some other page or there is other influencers let's say
(20:20) there are different kind of food bloggers those want to come to your place or your restaurant and basically review your food you guys can just engage with other accounts let's say when their followers or that particular famous food influencers follower see that guy going to a restaurant they'll be thinking okay uh this particular guy went there and told that the food is good so yeah the food will be good I guess so they will come to a restaurant and they will just taste your food and once they see okay their
(20:52) food is quite amazing as well okay so from that time onwards they will become a regular customer of your particular business okay so this is about having conversation with your followers how you can actually maintain interactive communication uh you should always reply to their comments make sure to comment in others post as well anything related to your Niche and also you need to make sure that you are engaging with other people uh other critics other accounts over here as as well okay so lastly we do have few of the other options which
(21:33) is to try for geotext okay so I have already told you guys that you can use hashtags in your bio okay we do have a separate class only on hashtags okay but I'm only trying to focus here is geotags so what is geotags so in the bracket you guys can see these TXS are based on our location let's say you are actually putting up a video okay so over there only not the niche let's say you are making a video on food so you guys can't just only put like hasht uh restaurant hasht food you guys can just tell that
(22:12) let's say if you're doing a video in Minnesota okay in that case what you guys can put is Hash Foods in Minnesota okay or Foods hype Minnesota so you guys can use your location so once people search that best places to e in Minnesota or best place to eat in Houston so if you just put all this particular Geo key tags or Geo hashtags your particular video will basically come at first if you have used those things quite well and it will show you them in their uh search bar okay they will see that your content will be
(22:52) appearing at first so they might click your video and they might watch it till last okay so this was about using geotex make sure to use it and also you need to understand that all types of content are useful in Instagram so it tells that you need to use all types of content maybe you will feel that okay uh post are not that effective or stories are not that effective or this real takes a lot of time to make but all the ways which are available in Instagram make sure to post all of this but if you're not able to catch up with
(23:30) the frequency let's say uh it is taking a lot of time for you just take time at first but don't just turn off okay so make sure to use all of this and don't leave any whether be whether it be a story whether it be a photo a video or a real or if you do have your business in which you need to go live as well you guys can go uh into Instagram and go live as well to have a better interaction with your follower so I hope this class was clear so I hope to see you all in the next chapter till then take care and goodbye everyone
