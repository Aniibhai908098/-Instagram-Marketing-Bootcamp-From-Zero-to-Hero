(00:01) hello everyone and welcome you all to another chapter of the Instagram marketing course so now we are on our chapter number eight where I'll be showing you guys about different types of content available in Instagram okay so we'll be learning what are the different type of content that you can upload into your Instagram handle so let's not waste time and let's get started so over here the topic is types of content okay so the first type of content which is available in Instagram which you can upload is basically the
(00:43) post okay so your post can basically content an image okay in most of the cases it does provide an image where you guys can share any kind of brocher let's say if you do want to share any uh kind of photo if you want people to interact with you if you just post on some questions in form of a photo you guys can basically do that okay and there they do basically have some of the settings like if you do want to resize your image uh in Instagram if you do want to basically uh put on some color Corrections if you do want to put on uh
(01:21) some small edits if you do want to do in Instagram you guys will be able to do that let's say if you do want a crop it if you want to do some basic color correction and also if you want to do some uh extreme level of color correction if you want to increase saturation and stuff you guys will be able to do that but post is one of the most uh used way where in Instagram people they do post uh their stuff into Instagram okay so over here it can be in form of a image in form of a video uh in form of a brush or anything else okay they do have a
(02:03) desired size and also a desired file let's say you can upload some pngs you will be able to upload some jpegs as well okay they do have some particular sizes which you need to make sure that your post are of that particular size because otherwise you do have to crop it and let's say if you do crop it too much and if your brocher is too big in that case you will see that the important informations which you want to share with your viewer might get cut out okay so in that case I always do prefer that before uploading make sure that uh go to
(02:38) your web page or your search engine from there just search for what is the Instagram story size or let's say what is the Instagram post size you guys will get that desired size and make sure to uh create your image in that particular size and they then post it into that desired platform okay that will be more better so so this was the first option which is post which is quite common and after this I'll be showing you guys each and everything in detail in Instagram itself like what is a post what is a
(03:13) video what is a story and stuff okay so now the next option is basically videos okay so the first one we supp post and the second form of sharing your content in social media is basically videos Okay so videos uh in nowadays are mostly uploaded okay so videos if you do have some longer videos let's say you guys can actually upload those let's say you do have any kind of classes and all okay totally depends on the niche that you're working on let's say if this is a attech business so in that case you guys can
(03:52) maybe put Sometimes some longer videos okay but it totally depends up to your skill that if it's a longer video how long you can actually get the attention of your student or the people who are learning okay because sometimes if the video is too big and it doesn't contain so much of uh interactive items in your video then people might get bored and they might leave your video halfway okay so that is not going to be a good impression to you and also for your follower in Instagram so you guys can use video format but you need to make
(04:30) sure that you do use some uh studing video creating options otherwise you guys can use different kind of video editing tools or video editing softwares like premere Pro you guys can use Adobe After Effects for your Motion Graphics you guys can use canva there is cap cut if you want to do it you guys can basically do that okay so the next form of sharing content in Instagram is stories okay so over here if you just take up a look on the right hand side of my screen there is image and on top you guys can see that there is heads okay there are
(05:15) circles so if you just click on those circles you guys will be able to see that particular story and basically story doesn't last for uh more than 24 hours but what you can do uh what you can basically do is if you don't want to save it you guys can save it up for later but from your story or from your account that particular thing will be removed after 24 hours let's say you guys can just put out some Daily News in your stories otherwise if you want to get some uh followers you guys can just give some interactive documents or
(05:53) interactive stories if you do uh want them to visit your website you guys can just search or you guys can just Post in your stories uh something related to your website and stuff you guys can basically do that right over here so stories are also quite interesting and stories are also uh quite better but here as we were basically talking about uh videos so there is another form of sharing your video is basically reals okay so there was Tik Tok if you guys know that there is that is another social media platform where people do uh
(06:34) actually share short videos okay so for Instagram real is the newer version of like Tik Tok videos okay over here what happens is that they do have short videos okay like 30 seconds sometime 20 seconds and up to 1 minute videos over here you will be able to upload and after that you guys can just take up a video and it shouldn't be too uh big okay so in that case you need to make sure that within a minute or within 30 seconds you cover all the information whatever you want to give it might be a scenario it might be just an
(07:12) advertisement okay it totally depends up to you that how you are actually portraying your company to your viewer or your customer okay so reals is quite famous noway most of the influencers also if you're doing influencer marketing uh they will go with uh reals they will be creating reals for you they'll be creating videos for you as well but as reals is of a small duration right like real doesn't contain too much of time so in that case what happens is our human mind uh are able to see like if I'm just playing a video in YouTube
(07:50) just think it uh practical let's say I'm playing a video in YouTube and that is around 5 to 7 minutes but within 5 to 7 minutes I will be able to see a lot of contents let's say I will be able to see around 20 reals okay so there what happens is I'm getting information about 20 different things within 7 minutes okay so our human brain what happens is like it is not able uh to get something new out of only one video so we might get bored by just looking at one video so we are basically shifting into smaller contents okay they
(08:29) do have their advantages and also they do have their disadvantages as well but always we need to make sure that we should follow the trend okay so we need to make sure that we follow the trend and basically try to follow the algorithm over here as well so we do have learned that there are mostly four kinds so the first one is post if you do want to upload any kind of videos you guys can upload videos into your account as well then comes the story which basically disappears after 24 hours and lastly we do have the reals which is a
(09:07) shorter format of a video okay so now let's see what is the difference between reals stories and post okay so I do have actually divided all of this into different kind of criterias over here okay so we will just start from the beginning so the first criteria over here is basically engagement bit okay so over here if you take a look uh with research and all in today's date they do have found that reals basically do have a high engagement rate among people okay so you need to think that what is the type of people that do use uh
(09:49) this Instagram okay so you guys can just look around who all uses Instagram and here according to the research according to the knowledge the reals those who are creating reals they do have a high engagement rate okay so if you're making reals make sure to use some nice videos make sure to use some nice video editing skills okay just check for the particular size from your web or like the web page size or the size of the document and you guys can just create those accordingly and also for Instagram Stories the engagement rate is basically
(10:29) High okay because it also disappears after 24 hours okay let's say if someone sees that you guys can basically put out different kind of stories let's say there is 20% off in my business to let's say you have a restaurant okay and in there let's say today is wedness day so what you guys can do is you guys can tell that wedness the special offer 20 20% discount and many people will basically view your story and they might visit your shop as well okay so that's a amazing right so stories and DRS do have
(11:02) a high engagement rate let's say you can actually put out in your stories like any kind of questions you are asking for suggestions like how you can improve your business there it actually increases your communication with your customer or your potential customers as well okay so over here you guys can see for real s Stories the engagement rate is high but come comparing to real and stories the engagement rate of post are less okay so over here what we do is we do basically post but over there sometimes we will see that people
(11:44) basically uh do comment but there might not be so many comments if you don't have uh enough subscribers but at first the engagement rate of reals and stories are basically High okay and the next point or the next criteria is can go viral okay so what mostly goes viral in this particular platform so if you see in case of reals it's very high okay so if you do have a real which actually have uh the whole information what you are trying to put let's say you are comedian and you did some nice standup
(12:21) comedies and it went viral okay so that is a video right and that do have a very high chance of getting viral and also if you do put any kind of stories and in stories also you guys can just put up a 15 seconds video okay Max you guys can put a 15 seconds video and sometime if you want to put a total video itself you guys can also do that so there also the chances of getting uh that Viral is also high but in case of post it is basically less so the next option is easily created so the criteria over here is easily created and it means that how
(13:03) much time or how much effort do you need to put to make a video so over here it is not being easily created so it's not very easy to create a real first what you need to do is you need to have idea about video editing you need to have idea that what you are trying to present and again you need to make sure that the whole concept that you're planning on will you be able to put that that inside a 30 seconds point or a one minute Point okay so you need to have a proper planning you need to have a proper video
(13:37) editing skills and stuff and then only you will be able to create a real okay but if you compare real with stories and post those can be easily created let's say you just click a photo with your phone or you do just click up a video of uh your place okay in that case you guys can just post that story up you guys can just post that thing in your platform as well so those are actually easier so over here now the next criteria is caption can be added okay if you do want to put out any kind of caption after your uh video or and all
(14:19) like if you do want to tell what your video is all about or what your story or what your post is all about in that case you guys will be able to add a caption for your reals but not for your stories okay because stories are there on top you just need to click and after 24 hours it basically vanishes so what happens is that the communication in stories or you won't be able to add any kind of caption to it let's say you will be able to put on some uh clickable links but not a caption okay but in case of a real in case of a post you guys
(14:59) will be able able to add a caption on those okay and the next criteria is helps to build trust okay so real basically doesn't help you to build trust among you and the viewer who is basically watching your video okay so the rate is basically low and for stories it actually helps you to build trust between you and also the one who is trying to get your uh service okay or with your business so if you just put out some things like uh today is this particular offer come visit to our shop and once they come there and
(15:39) they really see that okay this particular offer is going on and once they're satisfied it actually helps to build trust among them and same goes with the post comparing to stories it doesn't help that much to build up the trust okay and the next point is link can be provided okay suppose you do have a link which you want to post okay which will redirect them to a different page or to a different website okay let's say you have a attech company okay and in that particular attech company now you do have a new e-learning course let's
(16:18) say you do have added a new e-learning course regarding video editing itself so in a real you won't be able to give that clickable link okay and also in stories you guys won't be able to provide that clickable link using which they will be able to go directly to your website that they can go there and they can just check out what your uh course is all about do they want to buy that or not but in a post once you post let's say once you post a brocher people come there and people see okay okay he basically do have uh video editing
(16:52) course okay I need to learn video editing so what you do is you go to the description of that video or or that particular post and from there you click on the clickable link which will redirect you to that particular course or to that particular website okay so link can be provided only in post so over here I hope you guys have got up a basic idea about this criteria and what is their range so each and everything or each and every kind of content over here are basically important nothing is like oh it's not very important it's too
(17:30) important but all these things should be mixed up and should be adjusted in your uh calendar like in your social media calendar or in your scheduling like at this time I will be posting a story at this particular time of the day I'll be posting a reel or let's say three days once I'll be posting a reel and every day I will be posting one brocher or one flyer in my account okay so so you need to actually make up a calendar and make sure to follow those over here as well okay so lastly basically if you're
(18:09) trying to create different kind of post it can be basically summarized okay so now uh before moving on to that in summary if I if you want me to tell that in summary basically stories increases sales and Trust whereas reals and photos basically increases the reach and Trust of the follower okay so here you guys can see basically stories will increase your sell and Trust among the people and the real and photos will basically increase the reach and Trust among people as well so if you want to push yourself maybe uh better make some
(18:51) better stories and if you want to increase your reach among people make sure you post reals and phot photos on a regular basis and basically there for content of Instagram which can be used in two different ways one is you do have your own camera setup you do have own or all of your own content or you're making graphic design all of your own you guys can do that which comes under the category of new content and the next thing is basically the modified content so what you can do is you guys can take some uh strike free videos or strike
(19:29) images and also use that in your work by editing those things in such a way that it won't be affected or it won't get strike down so yeah I hope you guys have caught up a basic idea about the different kind of content available in Instagram now let's move on to Instagram let's see uh what a post looks like what a story looks like and what a video looks like and what caption we are talking about so over here on my screen and you guys can see I here in the homepage of Instagram so if you come to the homepage
