(00:02) hello everyone and welcome you all to another chapter of the Instagram marketing course so now we are on our chapter number seven where I'll be showing you guys about the Instagram account call to action okay so over here I'll be showing you guys how you will be able to put that call to action what it is what is the difference between call to action in a post uh versus the call to action for a whole account so let's not waste time and let's get started so the very first thing what you need to understand over here is this
(00:44) call to action buttons are basically provided to receive an action from the viewer okay let's say some viewer basically comes to your Instagram account okay so there is a purpose right you to have your individual purpose let's say with time to time so today what you want to do is you just gave the call to action button to your website so what do you want people to come to your website or people to come to your Instagram account and from there you actually want to redirect them to your website let's say you do provide any
(01:23) kind of sales or you do provide any kind of service and also it depends that whether it's offline service or whether it's an online service okay let's say if you're providing an online service and you do have a career business okay you do transfer uh some of the products like beauty products or thing so you do have a particular Facebook page as well so there you actually take up the calls or you just take up these orders so in that case your purpose will be that the people who are visiting you in Instagram
(02:00) you want them to come into your Facebook account and to place the order right so in that case your action or your main objective will be that people do click on your call to action button and they do come to your Facebook page so there you will be giving the link in which they do have the call to up action button as their Facebook page okay so this is the thing in very simple words and also the next point is that account CTA which is call to action and a post CTA are two different things okay so account CTA is basically uh for a time
(02:47) being of your account let's say your account as a whole what you are expecting okay what are you exactly expecting from your viewer like do you want them to give directly to your website so that can that you guys can just put on top but if I'm talking just only about post CTA let's say you posting three contents in a week okay so what you do the post C is kind of different because you are trying to meet that small needs upon time okay for post CTA but for account CTA you are actually putting it for your whole account like
(03:28) as a whole account what you trying to achieve from Instagram for your business okay that is the goal but for post let's say Okay I want to increase my follower okay so I will just give some kind of post which is uh which will help me to increase my follower okay I will see what is uh my reaction in that post let's say if I do give some interactive Post in that particular post I want people to interact with me in some senses okay so according to that I will give that post or let's say I want to popularize any hashtag okay regarding
(04:06) some recent event so in that case also what I can do is I can just promote those things over here as well so these are a few different type of things okay so this account CTA and post CTA are two different things and the next Point what I'm going to say is CTA basically can be changed with time let's say it's not that if today you do have your website in your CTO or in your call to action button after 6 months also you should have that sa okay it totally depends up to the need of your business let's say
(04:42) at this particular Point your company needs lot of sale okay otherwise your company now basically needs a lot of reach so regarding that you guys can actually uh do some research for your business look at the business Analytics and also there are few of the websites from where you guys can go and basically check that who all have clicked on that particular button okay and also there are few of the websites I'll be showing you guys one where you guys can actually put only one link and once they click on that one link they will be redirected to
(05:22) uh different pages like they will have the option like do they want to go into your YouTube channel do they want to go to your website kind of things like that okay so now let's move on to Instagram and let's see how practically the call to action button basically works so over here as you guys can see now I'm here in the homepage and now uh the next thing what I want to show is basically how or what a call to action button is let's say I will just click onto this particular page and over here you guys can see that they
(06:02) do have a description over here and underneath right here they do have a particular link okay so now if I just click on this link over here you guys can see that now I can basically go into their YouTube account if I do want to if I do want to go into their Facebook account I can just click here I can go to their Facebook account and if I want to check their store location as their uh sneaker sellers like they do uh sell different kind of sneakers okay you guys can actually check their locations otherwise if you do want to directly go
(06:42) into their website you guys can just directly go onto their website from here itself okay so here you guys can see what is their call to action or what they want from their Instagram Channel their viewer to go let's say if anyone wants to order any kind of shoes they can come here just click on that link and if they directly want to go to the website can just click it over here and you guys can see that I am basically redirected to their page okay so this how this call to action button basically works okay so now if I just close this
(07:20) thing down right now here you guys can see now uh what are most of the things or the call to action button is okay so again if I just come here and let's say go back and I'll just check few more of this okay let's come here and also if I just go to this particular website which is known as good code for them here you guys can see uh this is a book okay so here you guys can see uh the one who have this particular page she do have a book which name is how to stop breaking your own heart okay and over here you
(08:00) guys can see that she do have a link tree option okay where you guys can have multiple of uh links over here so once I click on this particular link here you guys can see that it will redirect me to all these options okay so from here what she basically wants me to do do she want me to go to Amazon from here do she want me to go to the water stones option or over here uh she's actually redirect me redirecting me to her book okay let's if I don't buy her book I can come here and I can go to Amazon from and basically it
(08:41) will just give me her link of her book and from here I can basically buy her uh book if I do want to okay and same way if I just come here those are also different websites which will redirect me to hard book itself okay so I'll just re check all cookies and here the main goal of her is basically that you come to her website and from here you do click on the call to uh call to action button and from here you guys just Reda yourself to buying her book okay so here you guys can do that and also if you do want to
